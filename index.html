                    Shared branching
                    Shared branching is a unique feature of SACCO.This is because SACCOs are often local institutions and they lack a widespread network of ATMs and branches.
                    However, in many cases, users can utilize the branches and ATMs of SACCOs for free via a shared branching network.
